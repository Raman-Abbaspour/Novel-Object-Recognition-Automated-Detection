# NORAD: Novel Object Recognition Automated Detection
## Overview
This is the public version of NORAD. NORAD is an innovative, open-source platform designed for the analysis of rodent behavior, particularly in the context of novel object recognition memory (NOR). Developed with deep learning technology, NORAD aims to address the limitations of traditional NOR tests by offering a high-throughput, unbiased, and customizable solution for behavioral analysis.

## Features
- Customizable Analysis: Tailor NOR parameters to fit specific research needs.
- High Throughput: Automates data analysis for efficient memory performance quantification.
- Unbiased Quantification: Machine learning minimizes observer bias, ensuring reliable results.
- Novel Parameters Extraction: Identifies unique behavioral patterns and performance metrics.
## Getting Started
